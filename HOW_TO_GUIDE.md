# MissFits Website - Quick How-To Guide

This is a simplified guide for managing the MissFits boutique website content.

## 🛍️ Adding a New Product

### Step 1: Get Your Product Images Ready

1. Take good quality photos of your product
2. Save them as `.jpg` files
3. Name them with numbers like `10.jpg`, `11.jpg`, `12.jpg`
4. Put them in the `img/product/` folder

### Step 2: Add Product Information

1. Open the file: `data/products.json`
2. Copy the format from an existing product
3. Change the details for your new product:

```json
{
  "id": "product-004",
  "name": "Beautiful Silk Blouse",
  "category": "blouses",
  "description": "A gorgeous hand-stitched silk blouse perfect for special occasions",
  "price": "₹3,500",
  "images": ["img/product/10.jpg", "img/product/11.jpg"],
  "mainImage": "img/product/10.jpg",
  "sizes": ["S", "M", "L", "XL"],
  "colors": ["Red", "Blue", "Gold"],
  "availability": "In Stock"
}
```

3. Make sure to:
   - Use a new product ID (like product-004, product-005, etc.)
   - List your image file names correctly
   - Choose the right category: `blouses`, `kurtas`, `sarees`, or `dresses`

## ⭐ Making Products Featured on Homepage

The homepage shows the **first 3 products** from your product list as featured items.

### To change featured products:

1. Open `data/products.json`
2. Move your favorite products to the **top** of the list
3. The first 3 products will automatically appear on the homepage

**Example:** If you want "Beautiful Silk Blouse" to be featured, move it to position 1, 2, or 3 in your products list.

## 📸 Adding Images to Gallery

**IMPORTANT:** The gallery automatically displays all product images from the `img/product/` folder!

### How the Gallery Works

1. **Automatic Loading:** The gallery page automatically finds and displays all images from your `img/product/` folder
2. **Supported Formats:** `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.webp`
3. **Numbering:** Images should be numbered (1.jpg, 2.jpg, 3.jpg, etc.) up to 50
4. **No Manual Editing:** You don't need to edit any HTML files!

### To Add Images to Gallery

1. **Take your photos** and save them as high-quality images
2. **Name them with numbers:** `10.jpg`, `11.jpg`, `12.jpg`, etc. (continue from where you left off)
3. **Put them in the `img/product/` folder**
4. **That's it!** They will automatically appear in both:
   - The gallery page
   - Available for use in products

### Image Requirements

- **File formats:** `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, or `.webp`
- **File size:** Keep under 500KB for faster loading
- **Quality:** Use good lighting and clear shots
- **Naming:** Use sequential numbers (10.jpg, 11.jpg, 12.jpg, etc.)

**Note:** The gallery shows ALL product images, so make sure all images in `img/product/` are ones you want to display publicly!

## 📁 File Organization

```
Your Website Folder/
├── data/
│   └── products.json          ← Product information goes here
├── img/
│   ├── product/              ← ALL product photos go here (1.jpg, 2.jpg, etc.)
│   │   ├── 1.jpg             ← These appear in gallery automatically
│   │   ├── 2.jpg             ← AND can be used for products
│   │   ├── 3.jpg             ← Keep adding with next number
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── logo.png              ← Website logo
│   └── title.svg             ← Website title
├── gallery.html              ← Gallery page (auto-loads from img/product/)
├── index.html                ← Homepage
└── (other files)
```

### Key Points:

- **Gallery images = Product images:** The gallery automatically shows all images from `img/product/`
- **Sequential numbering:** Use 1.jpg, 2.jpg, 3.jpg, etc.
- **Next image number:** Currently you have images 1-9, so add new images starting from 10.jpg
- **Automatic display:** No need to edit HTML files for gallery updates

## � Managing Maintenance Banner

A maintenance warning banner is available on the Product and Store pages to alert visitors when updates are in progress.

### Temporarily Hide the Banner

To temporarily hide the banner without removing it:

1. Open the file (`product.html` or `store.html`)
2. Find this section in the JavaScript:

```javascript
// Maintenance banner controls
const maintenanceBanner = {
  show: function () {
    document.getElementById("maintenanceBanner").style.display = "block";
  },
  hide: function () {
    document.getElementById("maintenanceBanner").style.display = "none";
  },
  // Set to false to disable the banner completely
  enabled: true,
};
```

3. Change `enabled: true` to `enabled: false` to hide the banner
4. Save the file

### Permanently Remove the Banner

When maintenance is complete, you can permanently remove the banner:

1. **Remove HTML:** Delete the entire banner HTML code:

```html
<!-- Maintenance Warning Banner - Remove when maintenance is complete -->
<div id="maintenanceBanner" class="maintenance-banner">
  <div class="maintenance-content">
    <span class="maintenance-icon">⚠️</span>
    <span class="maintenance-message"
      >This page is currently under maintenance. Some features may be
      temporarily unavailable.</span
    >
    <button
      class="maintenance-close"
      onclick="document.getElementById('maintenanceBanner').style.display='none'"
    >
      ✕
    </button>
  </div>
</div>
```

2. **Remove JavaScript:** Delete the maintenance banner controls:

```javascript
// Maintenance banner controls
const maintenanceBanner = {
  show: function () {
    document.getElementById("maintenanceBanner").style.display = "block";
  },
  hide: function () {
    document.getElementById("maintenanceBanner").style.display = "none";
  },
  // Set to false to disable the banner completely
  enabled: true,
};
```

3. **Simplify Initialization:** Replace:

```javascript
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
  // Check if maintenance banner should be shown
  if (!maintenanceBanner.enabled) {
    maintenanceBanner.hide();
  }

  // Load the product details/gallery
  loadProduct(); // or loadGallery();
});
```

With:

```javascript
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", loadProduct); // or loadGallery
```

4. **Optional:** Remove CSS styles for the maintenance banner from `css/product.css` if they're no longer needed.
